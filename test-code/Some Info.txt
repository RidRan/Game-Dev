Hi!
Thanks for downloading the sorce code for my Pong game.

You can just compile the win32_platform.c file however you want (it includes the other files).
If you want to build it with the flags I used, you can run the build.bat from a terminal initialized for the Visual Studio compiler (the cl command).

You can do whatever you want with the code, but I am providing it as is without any warranty whatsoever.

I hope you enjoy it.
If you happen to do something cool with it (even just learning) I'd love to know about it!
